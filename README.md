Bakery App that create at least 15 baked goods and save it into a collection of data.
 Each baked good has a name, price, an expiration date, one or more diet 
 restrictions (ie. gluten allergies), and quantity in stock. The program should 
 allow the user to search by diet restrictions and print all matching results.
